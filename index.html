    <h2>My Second Paragraph</h2>
      <p>Captain Rex fist appeared during the Star Wars The Clone Wars movie, with Ashoka Tano in 2008. The battle was for liberating the planet Cristophsis from the Separatist. The attacks were commanded by General Kenobi and General Skywalker.</p>
    <h3>Characteristics of Captain Rex</h3>
      <p>One of the best Caotains during the clone wars and th emost respected in the fact that even though hi vas given instruction from his superiors, he knew when there were wrong or good orders, and if they were bad he ignired them and did the good way. The amount of tactics and victories he led showed us of his valor and courage, his intelligence, charisma and his gut to overcome advcersity.</p>
    <h4>Conclusion</h4>
      <p>After Captain Rex disobeyed order 66 with the help of Ahhsoka, they separated and started a new life. After some years they reunited to help the rebels against the empire,affirming that Rex is a good person and allways helps the people that are doing the right thing.</p>
